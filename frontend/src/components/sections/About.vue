                        We created MedAkcess with very audacious goals. Below are some of the things we hope to achive from this project 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>• Enhanced Diagnosis</b> – Building tools for doctors to augment their own diagnosis with more data, 
                        experience, precision and accuracy (e.g. radiology image analysis, Journal of Medicine Association 
                        papers on retina scan for diabetic retinopathy, skin lesion classification to recognize melanoma with high accuracy, 
                        medical history scraping, treatment outcome predictions)
                        <br />
                        <b>• Drug Discovery</b> – Computational drug discovery that intelligently hones in on the most promising 
                        treatments (e.g. speeding pharma drug development) <br />
                        <b>• Patient Care</b> – Machines that aid with monitoring, treatment, and/or recovery of patients 
                        (e.g. visual patient monitoring, autonomous robotic surgery, friendly medication and/or physical therapy robots)<br />
                        <b>• Research</b> – Instantly sifting through hundreds of new research papers and clinical trials that are 
                        published each day to make new connections (e.g. AI at University of North Carolina’s Lineberger Comprehensive 
                        Cancer Center)<br />
                        <b>• Sensory Aids</b> – Filling in for various senses that are absent or challenged (e.g. visual aid, audio aid)<br />
